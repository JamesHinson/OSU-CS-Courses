I know a few programming languages and have done my best to learn the ones I find interesting, or I feel I will be useful. I have a strong working knowledge of Python and C++, and have limited knowledge of Javascript, HTML & CSS, and Go. I have about 2 years working with Python and Javascript, almost three working with C++, and about a year each for the other languages. Iâ€™ve also learned how to use a few IDEs over time. For a Python IDE I have used Pycharm, and for all languages (including Python) I have used Atom, VS Code, Visual Studio, and the Notepad++ and Sublime text editors. Aside from self-teaching and a Javascript class in high school, I have taken ENGR 103, MTH 231, and CS 162. I am also currently taking CS 271 alongside this course.
