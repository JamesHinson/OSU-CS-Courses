                <h3>Music Performance</h3>
                <p>One of my largest hobbies is performing as a musician in many groups on & off campus! I am a percussionist, which means I play almost every instrument that doesn't use air to work. This includes mallet instruments like the xylophone, a number of drums, and other instruments like cymbals, whistles, and bells. On campus, I am most involved in the "Spirit and Sound of OSU" - the OSU Marching Ensemble, the Meistersingers choir, and the OSU Percussion Ensemble.</p>

                <p>Below you can see a few of the instruments I play and some of the groups I'm in:</p>

                <h3>Programming and Cybersecurity</h3>
                <p>Another of my big hobbies is exploring <em>programming</em> and <em>cybersecurity</em>. I am a member of the <strong>OSU Security Club</strong>, which participates in many national and international hacking and defensive programming competitions hosted by other public and private universities; governmental agencies such as the CIA, NSA, and FBI; and international corporations and partners.</p>

                <p>The three things I enjoy most about this hobby are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The ability to gain a deep understanding of the systems we use daily, finding the unintended ways they can be used to gain an advantage.</li>
                    <li>Being able to participate in international competitions and use what I learn in a practical way.</li>
                    <li>Getting to constantly learn new and exciting methods just being discovered in the industry.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You can find more information about the <em>OSU Security Club</em> at our <a href="https://osusec.org/">website</a>.</p>
