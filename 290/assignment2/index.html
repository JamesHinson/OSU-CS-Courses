            <h2>Web Development Concepts</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Definition of Terms</h3>
                <p>A website is a collection of related web pages or files, including multimedia content, typically identified with a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically accessible via the Internet, and they are usually built using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Websites serve various purposes, including providing information, entertainment, business services, social connectivity, and more.</p>

                <p>A web application is a software application that is accessed and operated through a web browser over a network, typically the Internet. Web applications are hosted on remote servers and accessed through a web browser interface. Further, web applications utilize web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side scripting languages like PHP for more advanced functionality.</p>

                <p>A web browser is a software application used to access, view, and interact with information on the Internet. It allows users to navigate between web pages, view multimedia content, and access various online services and resources available on the internet.</p>

                <p>A web server is a computer program or software application that serves web content to clients over the Internet. It responds to requests from web browsers or other client applications by delivering web pages, files, or other resources, typically in the form of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) responses.</p>

                <p>An HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request is a message sent by a client (such as a web browser or application) to a web server, requesting a specific action or resource. HTTP requests are a fundamental part of the communication between clients and servers on the Internet.</p>

                <p>An HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) response is a message sent by a web server to a client (such as a web browser or application) in response to an HTTP request. It contains the requested resource, along with additional information about the response status and metadata.</p>

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>Frontend design refers to the process of designing and creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It involves crafting the visual elements, layout, and interaction patterns that users will engage with when they visit a site.</p>

                    <dt>Efficiency</dt>
                    <dd>Design elements should be efficient in delivering the intended functionality without unnecessary complexity.</dd>
                    <dt>Ease of learning</dt>
                    <dd>The interface should be intuitive, allowing users to quickly grasp how to navigate and use the application.</dd>
                    <dt>Error tolerance</dt>
                    <dd>The design should minimize the occurrence and impact of errors, providing clear feedback and recovery options.</dd>
                    <dt>Engagement</dt>
                    <dd>The design should captivate users' attention and encourage interaction.</dd>
                    <dt>Effectiveness</dt>
                    <dd>The design should accomplish its intended goals effectively, whether it's conveying information, facilitating a task, or providing entertainment.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>The purpose of page layout tags is to structure the content of a webpage in a semantic and meaningful way. These tags help organize and arrange different sections of the page, making it easier for both users and search engines to understand the hierarchy and relationships between elements.</p>
